                    The North American <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> is one of the most beloved pests. 
                    Although they are usually not welcomed into the home, 
                    they are overjoyed when most people discover that a <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> has invaded their home. 
                    Unfortunately, House Hippos are so rare because House Hippos are impossible to breed in captivity. 
                    Therefore, you can rarely find House Hippos for sale in select stores, 
                    but their prices are steep since you must catch them in the wild.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you obtain your <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span>, there are many things one must keep in mind. 
                    For instance, you must be careful how you feed your Hippo. 
                    House Hippos that are in captivity are prone to eating disorders and overeating. 
                    Feel free to feed your <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> peanut butter and chips if you want but remember to keep your Hippo healthy. 
                    A healthy Hippo is a happy Hippo. Therefore, another essential thing to keep in mind for your <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> is hygiene. 
                    House Hippos spend 78.6% of their lives floating in the water. So make sure you purchase a large dog bowl mixing bowl for your new friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let us consider some activities you can do with your new <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span>. 
                    The House Hippos do like to go for a walk but remember their legs are short. 
                    Keep the walks to a maximum of 45.342 feet. If you got your <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> accidentally, 
                    most likely, it would have a family. 
                    In this case, your <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> will spend most of its time gathering food for its young and playing with them. 
                    If all else fails, try tickling the North American <span class="namestyle">House Hippo</span> as they love that.
